# MazeSolverRobot_TECHNEX2019
A robot capable of solving a maze, following a given trajectory. This robot had secured the first position among internals in Technex 2019, IIT (BHU) Varanasi.

## Problem Statement:
To make a line following robot with the ability to solve a given maze and also detect over-head nodes placed along the path.

## Our solution:
* We used PID to make the our custom built robot to follow the line.
* An altered version of the Left-Hand Rule was used to solve the maze.

## Hardware Used:

* Self designed chasis with PolyCarbonate Sheet for light weight yet firm mechanical integrity of the structure
* Arduino Mega
* BO motors
* Proximity sensor (to detect over head nodes)
*  QTR 8RC ,sensor array for line detection.
